abstract: >-
  This repository implements GFlowNets, generative flow
  networks for probabilistic modelling, on PyTorch. A design
  guideline behind this implementation is the separation of
  the logic of the GFlowNet agent and the environments on
  which the agent can be trained on. In other words, this
  implementation facilitates the extension with new
  environments for new applications. The configuration is
  handled via the use of Hydra.
