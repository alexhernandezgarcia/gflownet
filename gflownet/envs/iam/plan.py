"""
Environment to sample a plan of investments, namely an investment amount for each
technology.

The environment is designed as a Stack of N investment environments, with N the total
number of technologies. Each technology must be selected once, therefore the
inter-environment constraints restrict the choice of technologies to those that have
not been set yet.
