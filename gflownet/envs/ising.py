    Ising environment.

    States are represented by a D-dimensional numpy array, with D the dimensionality of
    the Ising model. Each entry of the array corresponds to a discrete variable.
    Terminating states must have all variables in one of the two spins, namely -1 or 1.
    However, the following intermediate values are also defined:
        - 0: unselected state, indicating that the variable has not been set.
        - 3: selected state, indicating that the variable has been selected for
          assignment of a spin.
        - -2: transitory state indicating that the variable has spin -1, but the
          variable needs to be toggled to move to a neutral state.
        - 2: transitory state indicating that the variable has spin 1, but the
          variable needs to be toggled to move to a neutral state.

    The actions of the environment can be of the following types:
        - Toggle variable: one action per variable or cell.
        - Select spin: -1 or 1
