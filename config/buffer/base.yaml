# Train and test data
# Both train and test are dictionaries with the following keys:
# - type: type of data. It can be one of the following:
#   - pkl: a pickled file. Requires path.
#   - csv: a CSV file. Requires path.
#   - all: all terminating states of the environment.
#   - grid: a grid of terminating states. Requires n.
#   - uniform: terminating states uniformly sampled. Requires n.
#   - random: terminating states sampled randomly from the intial GFN policy. Requires n.
# - path: path to a CSV of pickled file (for type={pkl, csv})
# - n: number of samples (for type={grid, uniform, random})
# - seed: seed for random sampling (for type={uniform, random})
