This is a reference for contributors to ``gflownet``.

To learn how to use the package itself, see the :doc:`/tutorial` or :doc:`/autoapi/index`.

.. tip::

    **Docstrings TL-DR**:

    Use `Numpy-style <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_ docstrings as illustrated in this :ref:`write docstrings-extended`.

    :doc:`write-documentation` contains a guide on how to write documentation in general AND how to use reStructuredText (which is the text format used in the docstrings).

    :doc:`write-docstrings` contains a guide on how to write docstrings in particular (which requires basic understanding of reStructuredText).
